The Spring Basics track covers fundamental conceptions of the Spring Framework through the lense of Spring Boot. This allows you to explore the basics in a very pragmatic and easy to learn way.

We will cover important concepts from the [Core](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/){:target="_blank"} section of the primary Spring Framework Documentation. It should give you enough information to feel comfortable reading and writing Spring applications and knowing where to look to find more information.
